## üìñ How It Works

1. **HTML**: Provides the structure of the profile card and buttons.
2. **CSS**: Styles the profile card and ensures a visually appealing layout.
3. **JavaScript**: Handles the logic for toggling the visibility of sections when buttons are clicked.

### JavaScript Logic
- Each button (`GitHub`, `LinkedIn`, `Instagram`) is linked to a specific section.
- Clicking a button toggles the visibility of its corresponding section while hiding others.
